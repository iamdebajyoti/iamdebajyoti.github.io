    Your contribution has helped to achieve overall SLA and meet delivery commitment. MQ being critical env for customer has lot of visibility. As Bestshore lead for MQ team, you have ensured proper Coverage from Bestshore alongwith coordination with onsite team to ensure smooth operation and support. Keep it up.

    You should continue your contribution to automation through UCMS. You have contributed in DECP induction /interview process. Appreciate that.

    You should focus on completing cloud certification to enhance your skill
