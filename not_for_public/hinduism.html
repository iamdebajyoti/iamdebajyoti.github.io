This is exactly the essence of Hinduism, all-inclusive. That is why it has withstood the test of time in spite of repeated onslaught both from within and outside, and assimilated every good aspects from everything. That is why it is eternal !!! There is a saying in Rigveda, the first book ever known to mankind, which depicts the Hinduism philosophy in a Nutshell - Ano Bhadrah Krathavo Yanthu Vishwathah- Let the knowledge come to us from every direction.

Hinduism is the ONLY religion in the world who has not only given birth to 3 more religions but also sheltered and nurtured their followers to grow.
Hinduism is the ONLY religion who is single handedly responsible that Zoroastrians (Parsis, the original Mesopotemians ), Jews (Israelis) and Bohra Muslims (original Egyptians) are still alive and thriving today.


Hinduism and the 3 religions who were born from it - Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism - have no concept of religious conversion through force, killings, coercion, deceit, threat or temptation.

Yet, we survived and succeeded without harming anyone.

Yes, Hindus - be proud who you are and what you are !! Because you deserve to be proud of yourself.
